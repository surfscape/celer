## Introduction

Celer is an app for Windows with the purpose of giving you back control of your system. The app is structured into modules that contain various features that help you maintain your machine optimized.

## Features

- Dashboard - real time information of the hardware
- Cleaning - clean up unnecessary files from the system (+ limited support for third party software)
- Optimization - general battery & energy data, sensors, memory, GPU, and more
- Maintenance - easy access to Windows internal repair tools and network testing (with option to change DNS system-wide)
- Privacy & Security - general information of the system's privacy and security ratings

## Installation

We currently only provide x64 binaries and setup files for Celer but x86 and portable packages are planned when we reach a stable release.

The setup is hosted on GitHub and can be downloaded either through [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/surfscape/celer/releases) or through [Celer's page on SurfScape](http://surfscape.eu/projects/celer/#downloads).

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit only)
- Minimum 1 GB of available RAM \*
- Minimum 100 MB of free disk space
- [.NET Runtime 9 (x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-9.0.5-windows-x64-installer) must be installed

<small>\* The actual minimum is 512MB, however this comes at a huge cost in performance and user experience</small>

## Roadmap

We are currently planning new features some of these include:

- Support for third-party tools (ex: AdWare Cleaner, TRON Script, Snappy Driver Installer Origin)
- A frontend for Winget with recommended software
- Light theme (already available on beta 2 but without a setting to change it)
- Multi-language support
- Run in the background (planned on beta 2)
- Tray icon support with a small dashboard for quick actions (ex: cleaning temp files, restarting services and checking system status) (planned on beta 2)
